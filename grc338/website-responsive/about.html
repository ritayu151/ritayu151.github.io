               <p> Tea Plus Cafe simply offers the yummiest drinks in the world! We just knew we wanted the world to try our boba milk tea and break cultural barriers. We also wanted to change the way people thought of boba and tea. We did not like how many businesses had less-than-stellar business practices and did everything behind a wall. We wanted to open up the boba experience for everyone to see. </p>
               <p> We use only the best quality tea and combine it with naturally fresh ingredients  to make every single cup, the yummiest drink in the world. We warmly welcome everyone to come visit us and taste our award winning tea drinks! </p>
